All the events notes organized by CERN can be reached via `CERN Indico <https://indico.cern.ch/>`_ page.

Search Engines for Theses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Theses are the first step to the research field. Hence, in general they are written in detailed and they are explanatory. Hence, starting the research by reading the theses is a good beginning. You will benefit more reading the theses than the reading relevant published paper. Here are some links for theses databases. 

- `OCLC WorldCat <http://www.worldcat.org/>`_

lists most dissertations for most colleges and universities in the United States and Canada and a great many from around the world.  

- `Open Access Theses and Dissertations <http://oatd.org/>`_

OATD.org aims to be the best possible resource for finding open access graduate theses and dissertations published around the world. Metadata (information about the theses) comes from over 1100 colleges, universities, and research institutions. OATD currently indexes 3,429,635 theses and dissertations.

- `ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global Database <https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10764096>`_

Searchable and browsable database of dissertations and theses from around the world, spanning from 1743 to the present day

UCL Discovery is UCL's open access repository, showcasing and providing access to the full texts of UCL research publications.

How to Find Review Articles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Review articles should be the starting point for your research.
Please read this `UCLA libraries notes <https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/review-articles/>`_ to get some tricks for searching review articles.

In general, using Web of Science or Scholar Google you can search all journal at once. However, sometimes it is still good to search for some specific journals.

Following tricks are useful for finding a good review paper. This is not always the case, but it is a good point to start.

- Instead of using "simple search", use "advanced search" and filter with respect to the  review articles

- Sort the papers with respect to the number of citations

- The newer one is better, hence sort with respec to published date

- Search for lengthy papers instead of shorter ones

There are also some journals that only publish review articles. By directly searching in those journals can help you also.

- `Annual Reviews <http://www.annualreviews.org>`_

- `Progress in Particle and Nuclear Physics <https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/progress-in-particle-and-nuclear-physics>`_

- `Reviews of Modern Physics <https://journals.aps.org/rmp/>`_

- `Reviews in Physics <https://www.journals.elsevier.com/reviews-in-physics>`_

- `Reports on Progress in Physics <https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0034-4885>`_

How to Read a Scientific Paper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is not an easy task to read an academic paper. It is hard to grasp all the ideas and calculation at once. Hence, it is better to benefit others' experience about handling this situation.
You will see some papers here to find your own way which best works for you.

- `How to Read a Paper by S. Keshav <./nu_studies/docs/HowtoReadPaper.pdf>`_

- `“How to (Seriously) Read a Scientific Paper,”Science | AAAS,  March 21, 2016.  <https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/03/how-seriously-read-scientific-paper>`_

Web pages to follow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should visit these websites as often as you are checking your instagram page !!

- `“Symmetry Magazine”  <https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/>`_ is a joint Fermilab/SLAC publication. Symmetry is your view into the world of particle physics. You should follow every articles published and read all of them if you are interested in particle physics. Also the images are so great that makes the reading much more clearer.

- `“Quanta Magazine | Science and Math News.” <https://www.quantamagazine.org/>`_ From their website: "Quanta Magazine is an editorially independent online publication launched by the Simons Foundation to enhance public understanding of science. Why Quanta? Albert Einstein called photons “quanta of light.” Our goal is to “illuminate science." You will find articles from physics, math, biology and computer science.

A tip for searching papers in specific journals using scholar google
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In `google-scholar  <https://scholar.google.com>`_ as in google you can use boolean operator. If you want to search in a specific journal let us say physics world:

::

    proton decay source:"physics world"

    # or

    proton decay source:"physical review letters"
